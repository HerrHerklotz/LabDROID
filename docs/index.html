                <h1>LabDroid</h1>
                <small>Welcome to the first all including rapid prototyping environment for Android.</small>

                    <h3>
                        Realize your next tech project with ease
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        LabDroid gives your the opportunity to implement a wide range of functions in an faster way like never before.

                <h3>How do it works?</h3>
                <p>
                    Extend your project with a new feature (e.g. GPS) requires three main tasks to be done:<br />
                    <ul>
                        <li>Find (and buy $$$) a matching chip</li>
                        <li>Read and understand the manual</li>
                        <li>Implement a bunch of functions to get this thing running</li>
                    </ul>
                    LabDroid jumps in place and delivers you direct access to the functions and hardware of your Android device with an easy to use graphical programming interface. This saves your lifetime, energy and money.

                <h3>Use cases</h3>
                <h4>Learning Basics</h4>
                Start to become the next Daniel DÃ¼sentrieb. With the inbuild IDE you have just to place two Nodes and you are able to play around with your first real sensor data.
                <h4>Developing Algorithm</h4>
                You have an idea for a new algorithm but no idea how it behaves on real data? No problem, with LabDroid you can send a live stream of sensor data to any other device.
                <h4>Extending Solutions</h4>
                If you have already build a mobile robot, you can use LabDroid as gateway for controlling and supervision. With a VPN solution you will be also able to interact over mobile communication with your robot. And of course you could just spend a few minutes to add GPS without additional costs!
