<h1>LabDROID</h1>
<h2>Rapid Prototyping with Android</h2>
<h3>What is LabDROID?</h3>
<p>
  LabDROID is an all-included rapid prototyping environment for Android which gives you direct access to a many hardware and software functions (e.g. GPS or Text-To-Speech).<br />
Here are some examples which shows how you can use LabDROID:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Learning Basics<br />
    Start the inbuild IDE and get your first real acceleration data. Now you can move your phone and see how the values changes!
  </li>
  <li>
    Developing Algorithm<br />
    Use LabDROID as data source and distributer. After fetching the data you can send them directly to a server! (Note: An inbuild solution for logging will be avaible soon.)
  <li>
  <li>
    Extending Solutions<br />
    If you have already build a mobile robot, you can use LabDROID as gateway for controlling and supervision. With a VPN solution you will be also able to interact over mobile communication with your robot. And of course you could just spend a few minutes to add GPS without additional costs!
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
In general, the goal of LabDROID is to optimize three factors of your next project.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    costs (you have bought your android device)
  </li>
  <li>
    time (e.g. get your GPS location with few lines of code)
  </li>
  <li>
    environmental impact (your android device was already produced, packaged and shipped)
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    JavaScript: write your code in one of the most used programming language
  </li>
  <li>
    IDE powerd by HTML: develop & supervise your code from any device
  </li>
  <li>
    WebSocket & REST API: build your own interfaces with HTML, JS and CSS
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>To get started with LabDROID, you should simply take a look inside the example directory. An additional quick starter guide will be shown if you start the application.</p>
